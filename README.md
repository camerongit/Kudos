# Kudos
PHP Website framework which uses MongoDB and Redis. 

## Kudos follows a pattern similar to MVC: ## 

* Pages are controllers which load/save Models. 
* These Models justify actions which are used to build the corresponding view  for that page.
* That view is placed inside of a template.
* The pages are created when different routes are visited, the Router constructs these pages.

** This is in an early stage of development, updates to the README will happen as I continue with the project! **
